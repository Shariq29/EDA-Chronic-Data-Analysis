# 🩺 EDA on Chronic Disease Data

A detailed **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** project focused on understanding **chronic disease patterns** and identifying key health and lifestyle factors influencing chronic illness.  
This analysis leverages Python-based data science tools to explore, clean, and visualize patient-level health data.

## 🧠 Project Overview

Chronic diseases such as diabetes, heart disease, and hypertension represent a major global health burden.  
Through this project, the goal is to:
- Analyze trends and correlations among health indicators.
- Identify high-risk groups based on demographic and medical features.
- Provide actionable insights for early intervention and disease prevention.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Clean and preprocess chronic disease datasets.  
- Explore demographic and medical variables (age, BMI, smoking habits, etc.).  
- Visualize patterns and correlations using various plots.  
- Derive insights to understand which factors most influence chronic diseases.  

---

## 🧰 Tools & Libraries Used

- **Python (3.x)**
- **Pandas** – Data cleaning and analysis  
- **NumPy** – Numerical computations  
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** – Visualization and statistical plotting  
- **Jupyter Notebook** – Interactive exploration

## 📊 Key Insights

1. **Age Impact:** Chronic disease prevalence increases significantly after age 40.  
2. **Lifestyle Factors:** Smokers and individuals with higher BMI have higher chronic illness risk.  
3. **Gender Analysis:** Males show slightly higher disease incidence, but gender-specific patterns exist.  
4. **Correlation:** Strong correlation between BMI, blood pressure, and chronic disease presence.  
5. **Preventive Scope:** Early lifestyle interventions can reduce risk among younger demographics.
